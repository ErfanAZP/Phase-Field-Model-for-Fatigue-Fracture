# Phase Field Fatigue Fracture Model 

DESCRIPTION:
This code implements a phase field method for simulating high-cycle fatigue 
fracture in materials. The implementation is based on an adaptive switching algorithm 
that alternates between Newton-Raphson and Modified Newton-Raphson solution schemes 
to optimize computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy.

This code benchmarks the fatigue crack propagation in a 2D single edge notched tension (SENT) 
specimen under displacement-controlled loading conditions. The phase field approach 
allows for natural crack initiation and propagation without predefined crack paths. 

KEY FEATURES:
- Phase field modeling of fatigue fracture mechanics
- Adaptive switching between Newton-Raphson and Modified Newton-Raphson solvers allowing faster simulation for HCF problems
- Multiple fatigue degradation functions based on various literature 
- Various strain decomposition strategies (Isotropic, VolDev, Spectral, NoTension)
- Support for monotonic, cyclic, and constant load amplitude fatigue loading (both displacement and force controlled)
- 2D plane stress and plane strain analysis capabilities
- VTK output for visualization in ParaView
- CSV output for post-processing and analysis
